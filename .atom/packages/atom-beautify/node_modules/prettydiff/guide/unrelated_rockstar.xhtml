            <h3>In the real world</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Becoming a rock star developer is all about competence, capability, and
                    personality. These are factors that often do not perfectly align to online
                    communities. In the real world it always comes down to the ability to solve a
                    given problem, the speed and durability with which that problem is solved, and
                    the ability to work with others and mentor.</p>
                <p>In the real world a developer has to work with people. These people could be
                    other developers, non-technical peers, corporate leadership, partner companies,
                    clients, or others. These people always notice how quickly a given effort is
                    completed relative to other developers and how well the solution works once
                    completed. These factors go towards a phenomenon called
                    <em>competence</em>. Competence is always under evaluation.</p>
                <p>In online communities the factors that govern success are generally tethered
                    to qualities of branding, product, and self-marketing. In the real world these
                    factors are nice to have, but are largely insignificant compared to the 3 prior
                    mentioned primary qualities. When self-promotion becomes an individual's most
                    enduring quality the individual will generally be labeled as political,
                    unfocused, or insensitive. Nobody in real world wants to work with people like
                    this, even other people sharing this same quality.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="personality">
            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Competence alone is not enough. The ability to receive a favorable evaluation
                    from people in the real world is directly biased by the developer's personality.
                    For example, an asshole will never be held up to the same level of capability as
                    a slightly less competent developer who is always pleasant to work with. This is
                    an internal bias that everybody carries and never goes away. In this manner
                    personality is a more important quality than technical competence, because
                    personality is generally easier to observe and faster to evaluate.</p>
                <p>The biggest challenge regarding personality is the ability to listen to and
                    perceive the non-verbal communication of those around you. In other words if you
                    cannot determine if you are an asshole by reading the people around you then you
                    probably are an asshole. People who struggle in this regard are almost
                    helplessly handicapped from becoming a rock star in the real world.</p>
                <p>Niceness is not directly related to a rock star personality. A rock star is
                    capable of exercising equal parts charm and authoritarian decisiveness depending
                    upon the given situation. The goal is often not to make friends, and certainly
                    not to make enemies, but to accomplish the current given task efficiently and
                    build enduring relationships in the process.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="honest">
            <h3>Honesty</h3>
            <div>
                <p>A rock star strives for honesty always. Honesty is a challenge that many
                    people frequently fail at. Total honesty requires a dedicated alertness into an
                    individual's own three forms of communication: verbal, non-verbal, and desire.
                    Verbal honesty relates to the truthfulness of what a person says. Non-verbal
                    honesty relates to a person's body language when speaking and the physical
                    responses when listening or receiving communication both verbal and non-verbal.
                    Honesty of desire describes a person's goals, intentions, and motivations.</p>
                <p>Honesty in desire is something many people struggle with. This struggle is
                    frequently referred by terms like
                    <em>cognitive complexity</em>
                    and possibly
                    <em>cognitive conservatism</em>. This is challenging because many people are not
                    honest with themselves. For instance a person may claim to make a decision for
                    the health of the product when instead they could be trying to impress a boss or
                    complete an unrelated objective. This internalized self-dishonesty results in a
                    pattern of behaviors that leave observers confused and filled with doubt or
                    remorse.</p>
                <p>It is challenging to detect honesty, and it is much easier to detect
                    dishonesty. This likely explains why external observers are frequently more apt
                    at detecting an individual's internal confusion than the individual. Dishonesty
                    is the greatest enemy of trust and rock star is somebody who has no trouble
                    inspiring trust. To avoid dishonesty means harmonizing verbal communications,
                    non-verbal communications, and desires.</p>
                <p>Once a total communication harmony is achieved positive behaviors replace
                    distracting behaviors, particularly: humbleness, dedication, and focus. It also
                    means a person is quick to accept and volunteer blame for failure and a
                    willingness to ask for mentorship. Rock stars are quick to admit when they have
                    shortcomings and welcome assistance.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="confidence">
            <h3>Confidence</h3>
            <div>
                <p>An unintended benefit to total honesty is
                    <em>confidence</em>. Even in the event that probability of failure is extremely
                    high a rock star is willing to openly discuss the perception of failure
                    particularly when not politically expedient. In other words a rock star remains
                    maintains confidence long after doubts are exposed.</p>
                <p>A common and extremely destructive quality that frequently emerges in the
                    absence of confidence is
                    <em>defensiveness</em>. Like with other desires an individual may not realize
                    when they are being defensive, but everybody around them will see it with
                    crystal clear clarity. Emotional defensiveness is an unproductive selfish
                    quality that distracts from a team effort.</p>
                <p>High confidence is required to challenge deeply held beliefs whether those
                    beliefs come from superiors, peers, or the rock star themself. This challenge is
                    called
                    <em>critical evaluation</em>. The ability to examine a new approach and
                    determine whether this new approach should replace conventions universally
                    taught by a highly respected university are often necessary and can cause
                    friction. The ability to perform this evaluation requires technical competence,
                    confidence, and a devotion to product and the current technology. It also
                    requires an ability to challenge popular concepts.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="popularity">
            <h3>Disregard for popularity</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Imagine, if you will, a bell curve diagram. If you need help there are plenty
                    examples online of the bell curve. In a measure of trends and competence the
                    substantial bulk of a given demographic will (almost universally) reside close
                    to the average of those surveyed. The exceedingly incompetent, as statistically
                    measured against the entire body of sample data, will be on one extreme end of
                    the bell curve and the rock star on the opposite end of the bell curve.</p>
                <p>The important consideration in examining data against a bell curve is that
                    both the incompetent people and the rock stars tend to be extreme minorities
                    once a large enough sample of persons is evaluated. This means there is
                    something different or irregular about rock stars that the general body of
                    developers don't have. This single special factor can be summarized as a
                    willingness to do things that are not popular. If, as a developer, you only work
                    towards popular concepts you are statically incapable of ever becoming a rock
                    star.</p>
                <p>This makes sense if considered from the perspective of technical challenges.
                    Challenging things will always be less popular, because challenge suggests
                    opportunity for failure, which in turn causes fear. A rock star developer will
                    tend to be both risk adverse and simultaneously really good at risk analysis.
                    That combination of factors eliminates the fear that comes with challenges and
                    allows the rock star the willingness and capability average developers do not
                    possess.</p>
                <p>My favorite example of this concept is
                    <em>jQuery</em>. A few years ago the jQuery framework achieved religious status.
                    Many developers required this tool and could not do their jobs without it. The
                    religious concept was so deeply embedded that many developers would never
                    consider questioning the use of jQuery, as in such a though process would never
                    arise. I had several developers refuse to attend job interviews once they became
                    aware there would be a technical evaluation and they could not use jQuery. A
                    rock star developer would either or already have the skills to operate without
                    this tool or would be willing to rise to the challenge.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="expectations">
            <h3>Set higher expectations</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Rock stars set unpopular high expectations that may impede progress in the
                    short-term but dramatically increase developer productivity in the long term.
                    Strong standards will unintentionally lower maintenance churn. A rock star will
                    limit the high standards they wish to impose. A real rock star does not set
                    standards merely for the point of writing standards or fulfilling a personality
                    disorder, such as
                    <em>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</em>.</p>
                <p>The primary difference between the high standards set by a rock star versus
                    those set by somebody with OCD is that a rock star can speak to qualities of
                    risk analysis, performance, profiling, searchability, and understandability
                    using research and quantitative data. The high standards set by an OCD type are
                    generally motivated by stylistic concerns (code vanity), irrational ordering
                    conventions, and other emotionally motivated factors that are hard to
                    quantify.</p>
                <p>I like to use the tool
                    <em>JSHint</em>
                    as an example. It is far more popular than the older JSLint and it is also less
                    terse and more flexible. JSLint is a far stricter tool, which makes it far less
                    popular, but any code that passes JSLint will always pass JSHint. The common
                    argument for favoring JSHint against JSLint is something along the lines of
                    "It's too opinionated.", which is completely misleading because JSLint is
                    extremely opinionated about its options and settings and so is JSHint.</p>
