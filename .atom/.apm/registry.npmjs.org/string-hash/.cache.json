The particular algorithm is quite\nsimilar to `djb2`, by Dan Bernstein and available\n[here](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html). Differences include iterating\nover the string *backwards* (as that is faster in JavaScript) and using the XOR\noperator instead of the addition operator (as described at that page and\nbecause it obviates the need for modular arithmetic in JavaScript).\n\nThe hashing function returns a number between 0 and 4294967295 (inclusive).\n","maintainers":[{"name":"darkskyapp","email":"devsupport@darkskyapp.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-09-20T15:10:18.191Z","created":"2012-11-20T15:10:40.757Z","1.1.0":"2012-11-20T15:10:42.180Z"},"author":{"name":"The Dark Sky Company","email":"devsupport@darkskyapp.com"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/darkskyapp/string-hash.git"},"users":{"fgribreau":true,"eterna2":true},"keywords":["string","hashing"],"readmeFilename":"","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"B5R279X37B46WL074LRXHJWY3\""}
