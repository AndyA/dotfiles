        Komodo User Project Templates Directory

Place template files in the "My Templates" folder to have them appear
in Komodo's "New Project" dialog.  Your custom templates will appear along
with Komodo's standard set of templates.

To create your own templates files, create a file in Komodo and select
"Projects | Save As Template..." or simply copy files into the "My Templates"
folder.

See "Custom Templates" in Komodo's on-line help for more information.
