        Komodo User File Templates Directory

Place template files in the "My Templates" folder to have them appear
in Komodo's "New File" dialog.  Your custom templates will appear along
with Komodo's standard set of template files.

To create your own templates files, create a file in Komodo and select
"File | Save As Template..." or simply copy files into the "My Templates"
folder.

See "Custom Templates" in Komodo's on-line help for more information.
